    <p>I was very lucky to be offered an Erasmus position, specialising in 'Immersive Design' at hogechool Utrecht. There I learned very valuable skills such as storytelling, creating engaging and interactive experiences and teamwork.</p></div></div>

        <p>We collaborated with the client, Beeld en Geluid, to design an immersive experience tailored for younger visitors at their newly renovated museum. Our team developed an engaging storyline where users assisted a group of characters in solving challenges throughout the museum, creating an interactive and educational experience.</p>

        <h3 className="projectFurtherTitle">[Elapsed Frequencies]</h3>
        <p>For the final project, we were tasked to build an immersive experience with peers that were interested in the same technology and subjects, so I teamed with three others to build 'Elapsed Frequencies', an immersive experience guiding the user through the development and growth of music. <br /><br />IThrough audio and visual technology we built an environment where through storytelling we could guide the audience through this experience. I was tasked to create the visuals which were projected on four walls.</p>
